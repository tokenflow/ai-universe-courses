# Top 10 Agentic AI Tools and When to Use Them





This table highlights the leading frameworks and platforms for building agentic AI systems autonomous AI agents that can reason, plan, and execute tasks collaboratively. Ranked from 1 to 10, each tool includes key use cases tailored to different needs, from low-code automations for non-technical teams to advanced developer-focused orchestration for enterprise workflows. These tools leverage large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent interactions, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and seamless integrations, making them ideal for scaling AI-driven applications in 2025. A new "Deployment" column has been added to indicate whether each tool supports cloud-based, on-premise, or both deployment options.
