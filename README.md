## How to Get Started

This theme can be used just as other [Jekyll themes][1] and support [remote theme][12],
see [the official guide][13] as well.

You can introduce this jekyll theme into your own site by either

The code highlight style is configurable the following entry in `_config.yaml`:

```yaml
syntax_highlighter_style: colorful
```

style can be added to [./assets/gitbook/rouge/](./assets/gitbook/rouge/).

## How to generate TOC

The jekyll-gitbook theme leverages [jekyll-toc][4] to generate the *Contents* for the page.
The TOC feature is not enabled by default. To use the TOC feature, modify the TOC
configuration in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
toc:
    enabled: true
    h_min: 1
    h_max: 3
```

## Google Analytics, etc.

The jekyll-gitboook theme supports embedding the [Google Analytics][7], [CNZZ][8] and [Application Insights][9] website analytical tools with the following
minimal configuration in `_config.yaml`:

```yaml
tracker:
  google_analytics: "<YOUR GOOGLE ANALYTICS KEY, e.g, UA-xxxxxx-x>"
```

Similarly, CNZZ can be added with the following configuration in `_config.yaml
