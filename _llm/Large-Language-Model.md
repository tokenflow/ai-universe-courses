## ðŸ“– Executive Summary â€“ Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models represent the cutting edge of AI, transforming how we interact with information, create content, and build intelligent systems. This page within *AI Universe Courses* curates the most valuable free learning resources focused on LLMs. The goal is to help learners understand the theory, architectures, and applications of models like GPT, LLaMA, PaLM, and beyond.

LLM education isnâ€™t just about training giant networks â€” itâ€™s about learning the full lifecycle: from tokenization and attention mechanisms to alignment, fine-tuning, deployment, and governance. By following the listed courses, students gain both the technical foundation and practical skills to apply LLMs responsibly in real-world domains.

## ðŸŽ¯ What to Expect from LLM Courses

* **Foundations of LLMs**

  * How they differ from traditional NLP models.
  * Core components: embeddings, transformers, self-attention.

* **Training & Fine-Tuning**

  * Scaling laws, datasets, and optimization challenges.
  * Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA, adapters).

* **Applications**

  * Text generation, summarization, reasoning, chatbots, code assistants.
  * Multi-modal extensions (text-to-image, text-to-audio).

* **Evaluation & Limitations**

  * Benchmarks, accuracy vs hallucinations.
  * Bias, safety, and ethical considerations.

* **Deployment & Governance**

  * Serving models efficiently (APIs, vector databases, RAG).
  * Privacy, compliance, and alignment with responsible AI practices.
